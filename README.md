### Backpropagation Feature Contribution

: Validating input contribution with Backpropagation in ANNs 

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

In this project, we implement and validate a backward approach to compute the influence of each input feature on the final output. 

This method stands in contrast to the forward method implemented in the previous research.
